### Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin), School of Physics

I am an Assistant Lecturer in the School of Physics at TU Dublin where I teach programming and data science, amongst other topics. 


My research interest mainly focuses on multiscale computational and mathematical modelling of soft matter with special emphasis in nanoscale physical-chemistry and bionano-interaction. I am also a member of the [Nanolab](https://www.tudublin.ie/research/discover-our-research/research-institutes-centres-and-groups/nanolab/) at the [Focas 
Institute](https://www.tudublin.ie/research/discover-our-research/research-institutes-centres-and-groups/focas/).

### Background:

I received a B. Sc. in Chemistry from the Universidad Simón Bolivar (Venezuela), a M. Sc. in Physics from the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (Venezuela) and a Ph. D. in Electronic Engineering from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Spain). I have been a postdoctoral researcher at Loughborough University (UK), University College Dublin (Ireland), Universität Tübingen (Germany), Institut Laue-Langevin and Université Grenoble Alpes (France). Since 2019, I have been a Lecturer in Physics at TU Dublin.
